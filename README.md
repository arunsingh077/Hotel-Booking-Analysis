# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Business Problem
In recent years, both the City Hotel and Resort Hotel have faced a substantial increase in cancellation rates. This has led to a multitude of challenges, including decreased revenue and underutilized hotel room capacities. To address these issues, the primary objective for both hotels is to reduce cancellation rates, thus enhancing revenue generation and operational efficiency. This report focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations and other factors impacting their business and annual revenue.

## Suggestions
To mitigate high cancellation rates and optimize revenue, we recommend the following strategies:

- **Dynamic Pricing Strategies:** Cancellation rates tend to correlate with pricing. Hotels should explore dynamic pricing strategies, offering competitive rates for specific locations and periods. Providing discounts to customers can also be an effective approach.

- **Weekend and Holiday Discounts:** Resort hotels experience a higher cancellation ratio compared to city hotels. Offering reasonable discounts on room rates during weekends and holidays can incentivize guests to keep their reservations.

- **January Marketing Campaigns:** Given that January exhibits the highest cancellation rates, hotels should consider launching marketing campaigns during this month. Offering promotions and packages can encourage guests to retain their bookings.

- **Quality Improvement in Portugal:** For hotels primarily located in Portugal, enhancing the quality of facilities and services can help reduce cancellation rates. Satisfied guests are more likely to honor their reservations.

By implementing these recommendations, both the City Hotel and Resort Hotel can work towards lowering cancellation rates and optimizing their revenue streams.
